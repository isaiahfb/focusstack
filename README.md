# focusstack

This project is an implementation of a focus stacking algorithm using Python for the class Computational Photography 2 at Scripps College. 

Focus stacking is a photography editing technique that takes a set of images taken with different points of focus and combines the most focused regions of the set of images to create an image that is more focused than any one of the individual images alone. 

This program was implemented in google colab and can be seen [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13jCNvWWeqKLcn4GA4CoRKeoQsksRMEge?authuser=3#scrollTo=XR15_ir1efeq).
